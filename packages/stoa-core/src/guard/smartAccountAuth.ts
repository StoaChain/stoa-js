/**
 * `smartAccountAuth.ts` — Smart Ouronet Account auth-path resolution
 * primitives.
 *
 * Standard Ouronet Accounts (Ѻ.) are guarded by a single keyset stored
 * in their `guard` field; the chain checks that one keyset for any
 * mutation. Smart Ouronet Accounts (Σ.) are different: the chain
 * runs `enforce-one` over THREE auth branches and accepts the
 * transaction if ANY one branch's keyset is satisfied:
 *
 *   1. the Smart account's own guard
 *   2. the current sovereign account's guard
 *   3. the Smart account's governor
 *
 * The first two are always keysets (Standard accounts can only have
 * keyset guards by construction). The governor field is polymorphic
 * — it can be a keyset, a keyset-ref, a capability-guard, or a
 * user-guard. Only keyset/keyset-ref governors are signable by the
 * codex — capability-guards and user-guards require on-chain
 * capability acquisition that lives outside the ZBOM scope.
 *
 * This module exposes three primitives the UI's AuthPathZone (and
 * any future HUB/CLI tooling) builds on:
 *
 *   - `classifyGuardKind(g)` — pure shape discriminator. Maps a raw
 *     guard payload (as returned by the Pact `UR_AccountGuard` read
 *     or the `URC_0027_AccountSelectorMapper`) into one of five
 *     categories: `keyset`, `keyset-ref`, `capability`, `user`, or
 *     `unknown` (corrupt / unrecognised shape).
 *
 *   - `extractKeysetFromGuard(g)` — returns the keyset payload from
 *     keyset / already-resolved keyset-ref guards, otherwise `null`.
 *     Caller is responsible for resolving keyset-refs (via
 *     `resolveGuard`) before calling this if they want the keys to
 *     analyse. Inline keysets pass through unchanged.
 *
 *   - `analyzeSmartAccountAuthPaths(...)` — given the three guards
 *     plus the codex pub set + manually resolved keys, runs the
 *     classifier + extractor + `analyzeGuard` pipeline for each branch
 *     and returns a `SmartAccountAuthPaths` summary suitable for
 *     direct UI consumption.
 *
 * What this module does NOT do:
 *   - It does not fetch guards from chain. Callers feed in already-
 *     fetched guards (from URC_0027 selector or `getKadenaAccountGuard`).
 *   - It does not pick which branch to use. That's a UX decision;
 *     the analyzer just reports the satisfaction state of all three.
 *   - It does not modify `CodexSigningStrategy.execute`. The strategy
 *     stays AND-required over its `guards: IKeyset[]` argument; the UI
 *     resolves OR-of-3 to one chosen keyset before calling execute.
 *
 * Added in v1.6.0.

/**
 * Pure shape discriminator. Does not throw, does not mutate, does
 * not fetch. Maps any value to one of the five `GuardKind`s.
 *
 * Each kind requires its FULL minimal shape: `capability` requires
 * `cgName` (string) AND `cgArgs` (defined) AND `cgPactId` (defined,
 * may be `null` per Pact convention); `user` requires `fun` (string)
 * AND `args` (defined); `keyset` requires `pred` (string) AND `keys`
 * (array); `keyset-ref` accepts EITHER casing of the ref field
 * (`keysetref` lowercase chain-native or `keysetRef` camelCase) for
 * defense-in-depth — the `normalizeKeysetRef` boundary helper is
 * applied at the chain-IO entry point so internal code only ever
 * sees the camelCase form.
 *
 * Under-specified payloads classify as `unknown` instead of silently
 * mis-classifying — callers branch on the surfaced kind to refer the
 * user to an Execute Code escape hatch when the analyzer cannot help.
 *
 * Discrimination order matters — we check the most specific shape
 * first so a guard that happens to carry both `pred` and `cgName`
 * (impossible in practice but defensive) gets the more-specific
 * label. Mirrors `<GuardTree>`'s `detectGuardKind` 1:1.

/**
 * Boundary helper for the `keysetref` / `keysetRef` casing split.

 * The Kadena chain emits the ref-object form with the lowercase field
 * name `keysetref`; the rest of the guard module standardises on the
 * camelCase `keysetRef` form. Apply this helper at the
 * `resolveGuard` boundary in `interactions/ouroFunctions.ts` so
 * internal code only ever sees the camelCase form.
 *
 * Pure / non-mutating: returns a NEW object with `keysetRef` mirroring
 * `keysetref` when only the lowercase form is present. The original
 * lowercase `keysetref` field is preserved on the returned object so
 * existing reads (e.g. `guardData.keysetref.ns`) continue to work as
 * defense-in-depth. Any other input — null, undefined, primitives,
 * arrays, or objects that already carry `keysetRef` — is returned
 * unchanged.
 *
 * `classifyGuardKind`'s `keyset-ref` branch keeps dual-casing
 * acceptance for defense-in-depth in case a caller bypasses this
 * boundary helper.

 * `branches` is always exactly three entries in canonical order
 * (guard / sovereign / governor) so the UI can render them with a
 * stable layout. The derived flags express the most common questions
 * a CFM modal asks:
 *
 *   - `anyKeyBased` — at least one branch is signable. If false, the
 *     ZBOM cannot satisfy this transaction; the UI should refer the
 *     user to the Execute Code page where they can construct an
 *     ad-hoc capability acquisition.
 *
 *   - `firstSatisfied` — index of the first branch whose keyset is
 *     fully satisfied by the codex (+ optional manual keys). Useful
 *     as a default selection for the UI's auth-path picker. -1 when
 *     no branch is currently satisfied.
 *
 *   - `firstSignableButUnsatisfied` — index of the first branch where
 *     `keyBased === true` AND `analysis.satisfied === false`.
 *     Supports the "you would be able to sign if you held key X" UX
 *     without a recompute. -1 when no such branch exists.
 *
 * Reachable states (the four cases the caller branches on):
 *
 *   A. `firstSatisfied >= 0` — a satisfiable path exists. The
 *      consumer can sign the transaction immediately by selecting
 *      the indicated branch. UI: highlight branch[firstSatisfied].
 *
 *   B. `firstSatisfied === -1 && anyKeyBased === true` — no
 *      satisfiable path, but at least one key-based path exists.
 *      The consumer should pick a key-based branch and prompt the
 *      user for the missing key (use `firstSignableButUnsatisfied`
 *      as the default selection).
 *
 *   C. `firstSatisfied === -1 && anyKeyBased === false && at least
 *      one branch.kind !== "unknown"` — no signable path, but at
 *      least one path is of a known kind. The consumer should refer
 *      the user to Execute Code or an equivalent ad-hoc capability
 *      acquisition flow.
 *
 *   D. all three `branches[i].kind === "unknown"` — the analyzer
 *      cannot help. The consumer should surface a clear error.
