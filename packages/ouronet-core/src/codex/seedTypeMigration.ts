/**
 * Seed-type migration — the naming layer between historical codex blobs
 * and the current canonical names.
 *
 * Background. Early OuronetUI wallets were written with `seedType: "legacy"`
 * (Chainweaver-derived WASM path) and `seedType: "new"` (Koala HD-wallet
 * nacl path). When ecko-wallet landed the third variant got a clean name
 * ("eckowallet"), but the existing "legacy" / "new" strings stayed live in
 * users' localStorage. Rather than break those codexes we migrate on load:
 * `legacy → chainweaver`, `new → koala`, everything else passes through.
 *
 * Canonical seed types are `"koala" | "chainweaver" | "eckowallet"`. The
 * migration is idempotent — applying it twice yields the same result.
 *
 * Moved out of OuronetUI's WalletStorage in Phase 4. It had no business
 * being there; it's a pure string-to-string mapping that every codex
 * consumer (UI + future HUB) needs.
