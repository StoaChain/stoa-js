/**
 * PlaintextCodex — the portable shape of an Ouronet user's in-memory
 * codex state. Consumers decide the concrete element types for each list
 * via generics (OuronetUI plugs in its IKadenaSeed / IOuroAccount / etc;
 * the future HUB can supply its own if it prefers, or reuse UI's via a
 * shared `@ouronet/shared-types` package later).
 *
 * Why generic? Because the codec (serialize / deserialize) and any other
 * core-side consumer only cares about the SHAPE — "there are N wallets,
 * M accounts, K pure keypairs, an address book, and some ui settings".
 * The field contents are consumer-defined. Generics let the type carry
 * information without forcing core to own every wallet-domain type.
 *
 * Default type params are `unknown` so downstream code that doesn't need
 * field-level types still works — `PlaintextCodex` with no args treats
 * each list as `unknown[]`, which TypeScript allows assignment TO but
 * nothing structured FROM (exactly right for a generic serializer).
