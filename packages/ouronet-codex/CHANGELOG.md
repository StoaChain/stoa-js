# Changelog

All notable changes to `@stoachain/ouronet-codex`.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-05-26

**Structural Prime invariants** — closes the last gap between OuronetUI's
hand-orchestrated `saveWallet()` and what the package enforces by default.
v0.1.0 partially implemented the CodexPrime ouro account but left the
Prime Codex Seed unprotected and the seed↔account linkage implicit; v0.2.0
makes both structural guarantees of every codex, enforced by the package
regardless of how a consumer chooses to install entities.

See [`docs/v0.2.0-design.md`](./docs/v0.2.0-design.md) for the full design
contract.

### Added

- **`IKadenaSeed.isPrime`** field. The Prime Codex Seed is structurally
  unremovable — `deleteKadenaSeed` throws `CodexPrimeSeedProtectedError`
  when called on `isPrime: true`. Symmetric to the existing
  `IOuroAccount.isPrime` (spec §B1, v0.1.0).
- **`CodexPrimeSeedProtectedError`** error class — structured error with
  `seedId` field. Exported from `@stoachain/ouronet-codex/errors`.
- **`CodexKickstartError`** error class — discriminated by `reason`:
  `"already-kickstarted"`, `"smart-account-not-allowed"`, `"id-conflict"`.
  Thrown by `kickstartCodex` / `recoverCodexFromMnemonic` pre-flight guards
  and by the tightened `addKadenaSeed` / `addOuroAccount` id-conflict checks.
- **`IOuroAccount.parentSeedId`** field. Causal identity binding — set by
  `kickstartCodex` to the prime seed's id, so CodexPrime is "the ouro
  derived from the prime seed" (causal), not "the first ouro added"
  (positional). Undefined for pure-keypair-derived accounts.
- **`kickstartCodex(args)`** action — atomically install the Prime Codex
  Seed + CodexPrime ouro account on an empty codex. Pre-flight: refuses
  if codex already has seeds, refuses if ouro is a Smart account. Sets
  `isPrime: true` on both + `parentSeedId` linkage. Auto-activates both.
- **`recoverCodexFromMnemonic(args)`** action — same shape as kickstart
  but for the recovery flow. Allows non-empty codex iff the existing
  prime ids match (idempotent re-install). Preserves unrelated non-prime
  entities (additional seeds, pure keypairs, address book). Does NOT
  auto-activate (caller decides).
- **`KickstartArgs` / `KickstartResult`** types exported from
  `@stoachain/ouronet-codex/state` (and via `useCodexLifecycle`).
- **`useCodexLifecycle()`** hook — exposes `kickstart` + `recover`.
  Single integration point for consumers wiring the package's "first
  codex creation" flow.
- **Legacy codex migration** in `actions.init(adapter)` — when a
  pre-v0.2.0 snapshot loads (≥1 seed but none flagged `isPrime`), the
  first seed is auto-flagged eagerly and the flag is persisted via
  `adapter.saveKadenaSeeds`. The ouro half of the migration is deferred
  to `authenticate(password)` because matching an ouro to a seed
  requires decrypting the ouro's secret — caller can wire this via a
  derive callback if/when surfaced.

### Changed

- **`addKadenaSeed`** — gained two guards: (1) auto-flags `isPrime: true`
  on the very first seed in an empty codex (backward compat with
  consumer code that doesn't yet use `kickstartCodex`); (2) if caller
  passes `isPrime: true` explicitly when a prime already exists, throws
  `CodexKickstartError("id-conflict")`. Also auto-activates the seed if
  no active is set (parity with `addOuroAccount`'s existing behavior).
- **`deleteKadenaSeed`** — gained two behaviors: (1) refuses on
  `isPrime: true` seeds with `CodexPrimeSeedProtectedError`; (2)
  cascade-deletes ouro accounts whose `parentSeedId` matches the seed
  being deleted. Cascade defensively skips prime ouros (so the
  CodexPrime invariant is never violated even via legacy data oddities).
- **`addOuroAccount`** — gained two behaviors: (1) id-conflict guard on
  explicit `isPrime: true` when a prime ouro already exists; (2)
  validates `parentSeedId` against existing seeds — drops the field
  (with `console.warn`) if no matching seed exists, guarding against
  typos.
- **`activeOuroAccountId`** — now defensively re-pointed when
  `deleteKadenaSeed`'s cascade removes the currently-active ouro.

### Migration guide (v0.1.0 → v0.2.0)

For consumers (OuronetUI, AncientHoldings):

- **No breaking changes.** Every v0.1.0 export keeps its signature; new
  surface is additive.
- The **preferred path** for creating a new codex is now
  `useCodexLifecycle().kickstart(args)` instead of separate
  `addKadenaSeed` + `addOuroAccount` calls. This guarantees the prime
  invariants without consumer-side discipline.
- Existing localStorage codexes from v0.1.0 migrate automatically on
  next load — the first kadena seed gets `isPrime: true` eagerly. No
  user-visible action required.
- Backup/restore files (v1.2 wire format) carry the new fields as
  additional properties; v0.1.0 parsers ignore them (additive JSON).
  Importing a legacy backup into v0.2.0 triggers the same migration
  via the underlying `init()` call.

### Tests

- 161 specs total (143 pre-existing + 18 new in `state-store.test.ts`):
  Prime Codex Seed protection, kickstart pre-flight guards, recover
  semantics (empty / idempotent / id-conflict / preserve-unrelated),
  parentSeedId validation, legacy codex auto-migration.
- Two existing tests adjusted to reflect the new auto-prime-first-seed
  behavior (`deleteKadenaSeed`/`deleteSeed` tests now exercise the
  non-prime path against `s2` instead of `s1`).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-25

**INITIAL RELEASE** — modular React Codex extracted from OuronetUI as a portable package any React consumer can drop in. Replaces the failed Caduceus-era custom integration attempt with a single canonical Codex any consumer (OuronetUI, AncientHoldings hub, future apps) shares.

Tracking under [`stoa-js/.bee/specs/2026-05-24-ouronet-codex-modular-package/spec.md`](../../.bee/specs/2026-05-24-ouronet-codex-modular-package/spec.md). Per-phase deliverables get logged here as they land.

### Phase 2 — Scaffold (2026-05-24)

- New monorepo sibling at `packages/ouronet-codex/` matching the structural conventions of `packages/ouronet-core/` (subpath-export model, `tsconfig.json` + `tsconfig.build.json` split, vitest with monorepo source-resolution aliases, near-empty `src/index.ts` root entry).
- `package.json` declares 8 subpath exports (`/provider`, `/hooks`, `/components`, `/adapters`, `/resolver`, `/errors`, `/types`, `/google-drive`).
- Peer-deps: `react@^18 || ^19`, `@stoachain/{kadena-stoic-legacy, stoa-core, ouronet-core}@>=4.2.2`. Single regular-dep: `zustand@^5` (internal state container; invisible to consumers).
- TypeScript config adds `jsx: "react-jsx"` (vs the existing 3 packages' no-JSX configs).
- Vitest environment switched to `jsdom` (vs `node` in the existing 3 packages) since components and hooks will need a DOM at test time.
- Empty barrel stubs for each subpath with doc-comments pointing to the relevant spec section, so the import graph is well-formed from day one even before implementation lands.

### Phase 3 — Adapters (2026-05-24)

- `CodexAdapter` interface in `src/adapters/types.ts` — pluggable storage contract (loadAll/saveAll + per-entity convenience writes + touch + UI-settings sidecar + clearAll). Async throughout to accommodate network/file backends.
- `MemoryCodexAdapter` — in-memory implementation for SSR / Next.js server / tests. Uses `structuredClone` for defensive copies so callers cannot mutate persisted snapshots.
- `LocalStorageCodexAdapter` — browser default ported from OuronetUI's `src/kadena/wallet/LocalStorageCodexAdapter.ts`, including the v1.0.9 fix that emits `pureKeypairs` in the export and the per-entry seed-type migration with try/catch fallback to "koala".
- Address-book legacy fallback path preserved (some early codices stored addressBook at the persist-root rather than under the codex key).
- 36 contract tests parameterized to run against both Memory + LocalStorage adapters, asserting identical observable semantics.

### Phase 4 — State store (2026-05-24)

- Zustand store factory at `src/state/store.ts` (~320 LOC) covering the full §6 state model: hydration (ready / initError), auth (locked / passwordCache), codex content (kadenaSeeds / pureKeypairs / ouroAccounts / addressBook / watchList / uiSettings), runtime (active wallet/account, dirty bit, schema version, last-updated metadata), and a namespaced `actions` object with the full CRUD per entity.
- CodexPrime auto-flag on the first added ouro account (spec §B1); `deleteOuroAccount` throws `CodexPrimeProtectedError` on `isPrime: true` (spec §B2).
- Auto-active first wallet/account on `init()` for sensible defaults; clears active when the active entity is deleted.
- `persistAndTouch` helper centralises adapter write + dirty-bit + lastUpdatedAt update so every mutator stays one-liner clean.
- Password cache uses `cache.expiresAt <= Date.now()` (inclusive) so TTL=0 means immediate expiry.
- `_internal_requireUnlocked` exported for Phase 5 hooks that need to gate on unlock state from outside the store.
- 27 action tests covering every CRUD operation, CodexPrime protection, auth flows, active-selection management, meta operations, and reset.

### Phase 5 — Hooks + resolver + provider stub (2026-05-25)

- `InternalCodexResolver` (in `src/resolver/`) — implements `KeyResolver` from `@stoachain/stoa-core/signing` against the internal Zustand store. Replaces OuronetUI's `ReduxCodexResolver`. Three methods: `listCodexPubs` (sync set built from kadenaSeeds + pureKeypairs), `getKeyPairByPublicKey` (auth-gated, decrypts pure keypairs via `smartDecrypt` or re-derives from seed via `KadenaWalletBuilder` + `kadenaDecrypt`, returns `IKadenaKeypair` ready for `universalSignTransaction`), `requestForeignKey` (default-throws `CodexKeyMissingError`; consumers wire a modal callback via constructor options). Emits the structured `CodexKeyMissingError` introduced in OuronetUI v1.0.9 with the same self-diagnostic wording — every consumer now gets the same message.
- `<CodexProvider>` stub (in `src/provider/`) — minimal per-mount store + React Context plumbing. Required `adapter` prop, optional `deviceVariant` prop, fire-and-forget init on mount. Phase 7 will add `passwordCacheMinutes`, `onCodexDirty`, `signingClient`, `initialUiSettings`, auto-rendered `<PasswordModal>`, and SSR-safe placeholder shell.
- `useCodexStore()` internal hook — exposed only to the package's own hooks subpath; consumers go through the typed hooks below.
- **Hooks (`src/hooks/`)** — 11 React hooks:
  - `useCodex()` — high-level read of all codex state (ready/locked/dirty + content + meta).
  - `useActiveWallet()` — active kadena seed + ouro account, IDs + resolved entities + setters.
  - `useGetKeypair()` — stable async `(pub) => Promise<IKadenaKeypair>`. Throws `CodexLockedError` / `CodexKeyMissingError` to match resolver contract.
  - `useSignTransaction()` — replaces OuronetUI's `useCFMStrategy`. Composes `InternalCodexResolver` + `createClient(getPactUrl(KADENA_CHAIN_ID))` into a memoised `CodexSigningStrategy`. Re-memoised on `selectedNode + customNodeUrl` change so node switching takes effect immediately on next `execute()` call (same invalidation rule OuronetUI uses today). Accepts optional `requestForeignKey` callback for foreign-key signing.
  - `useCodexAuth()` — `{ isLocked, authenticate, lock, getCurrentPassword, passwordCacheExpiresAt }`.
  - `useKadenaSeeds()` / `usePureKeypairs()` / `useOuroAccounts()` / `useAddressBook()` / `useWatchList()` — per-entity CRUD wrappers around the store actions. `useWatchList()` is a Phase 5 addition beyond spec §5.2 (store actions for watchlist already existed; skipping the hook would leave 1:1 parity broken).
  - `useCodexBackup()` — `downloadAsJson` (browser `<a>.click` save), `importFromFile(File)`, `exportForCloud()`, `importFromCloud(json)`, `isDirty`, `clearDirty`. On-disk format is the v1.2 codex file plus `pureKeypairs` (OuronetUI v1.0.9 extension). Imports tolerate the absence of `pureKeypairs` so pre-v1.0.9 backups still restore. The hook bypasses `ouronet-core/codex`'s frozen v1.2 codec to allow the augmented format; codec stays a strict v1.2 wire-format reader for purists.
- **Tests (63 new)** — `resolver-internal.test.ts` (14), `provider.test.tsx` (4), `hooks.test.tsx` (~25 across all hooks, with real-crypto roundtrips kept in the resolver suite to avoid duplication). Combined with the prior phases: **101 specs total in the ouronet-codex package, all passing.**

### Phase 6a — Headless components (non-rotation) + password-prompt mechanism (2026-05-25)

Sub-phase split from Phase 6 — the 5 components that don't touch ouronet-core's
Pact builders. Phase 6b lands the 3 rotation modals after the atomic-triplet
bump to 4.3.0 adds the missing `buildRotateGuardPactCode` and
`buildRotatePaymentKeyPactCode` (only `buildRotateSovereignPactCode` exists today).
Phase 6 spec scope was deliberately not "all 4" — `<RotateGovernorModal>` was
deferred post-OuronetUI-migration per locked decision: chain has the Pact
function but no UI surface ships it yet.

State store extensions:
- `pendingPasswordRequest` slice (single nullable, dedup-to-one-modal contract).
- `actions.requestPassword()` returns `Promise<string>`. Concurrent calls
  share a single outstanding request (the dedup fans out resolve/reject
  to every waiting caller).
- `actions.submitPasswordRequest(pw)` calls `authenticate` then resolves
  the awaiting promise.
- `actions.cancelPasswordRequest()` rejects with `CodexLockedError`.

Hook additions:
- `useRequestPassword()` — fast-path resolves immediately when unlocked;
  otherwise triggers the modal-driven prompt via the store action above.
  Stable function identity, safe in useEffect deps.

Components (`src/components/`):
- `<PasswordModal>` — observes `pendingPasswordRequest`; renders nothing
  when null. Default markup is semantic `<div role="dialog">` + `<form>` +
  `<input type="password">` + submit/cancel. Full theming via `className` +
  per-slot render-props (renderTitle / renderSubmitButton / renderCancelButton)
  or whole-component `render` prop override.
- `<BackupRestorePanel>` — wraps `useCodexBackup`. Default markup shows
  download + restore-from-file buttons + header (with dirty-state badge).
  File-restore drives a hidden `<input type="file">` via programmatic click.
  Errors surface via an `<p role="alert">`. Render-prop slots for every
  element + a `downloadFilename` prop.
- `<AddPureKeypairForm>` — pastes a 64-hex private key, derives pub via
  `tryDerivePublicKey`, validates (length + hex-only), prompts for password
  via `useRequestPassword`, encrypts with `smartEncrypt`, persists through
  `usePureKeypairs.addKeypair`. Live derivedPublicKey preview + structured
  validation message + onSuccess callback.
- `<ActiveWalletPicker>` — two `<select>` dropdowns (kadena seeds + ouro
  accounts) wired to `useActiveWallet`. `hideKadenaSeedPicker` /
  `hideOuroAccountPicker` props for consumers that only surface one. Per-item
  render-prop slots for full option markup override.
- `<CodexInfoPanel>` — read-only stats panel. Default markup is a semantic
  `<dl>` showing status (ready/locked/dirty), per-entity counts, schema
  version, last-updated. Whole-component `render` prop for custom layouts.

Tests (+18) in `tests/components.test.tsx` — one describe per component
covering default markup, render-prop overrides, and underlying hook
integration. Plus `<PasswordModal>` round-trip tests (request → submit
resolves promise + hides; cancel rejects with CodexLockedError) and
`useRequestPassword` dedup test.

Workspace test totals after Phase 6a:
  kadena-stoic-legacy   55
  ouronet-codex        119 (was 101; +18 in Phase 6a)
  ouronet-core         788
  stoa-core            653
  total              1,615 passing, no regressions

### Phase 6b — Headless rotation modals + triplet bump 4.2.2 → 4.3.0 (2026-05-25)

Sub-phase 6b — the 3 rotation modals + the atomic-triplet bump that
adds the Pact builders they consume.

Atomic triplet bumped 4.2.2 → 4.3.0:
- `@stoachain/ouronet-core` adds `buildRotateGuardPactCode` (define/existing
  modes) + `buildRotateKadenaPactCode` to `src/pact/cfmBuilders.ts`. 9 new
  tests in `cfm-builders.test.ts`.
- `@stoachain/kadena-stoic-legacy` + `@stoachain/stoa-core` bumped in
  lockstep per the triplet invariant — functionally identical to 4.2.2.
- ouronet-codex peer-dep ranges bumped to `>=4.3.0` (the rotation modals
  require the new builders).

`<RotateGovernorModal>` deferred post-OuronetUI-migration per spec
locked decision — chain exposes `C_RotateGovernor` but no UI surface
ships it yet.

Components (`src/components/`):
- `<RotateGuardModal>` — two-mode form (define new keys + predicate, or
  reference existing keyset). Builds via `buildRotateGuardPactCode`,
  attaches keyset data slot in define mode, adds new-guard signers in
  define mode, dispatches through `useSignTransaction.execute`.
  Optimistically updates the codex's local guard mirror on success.
- `<RotatePaymentKeyModal>` — single-input form (new 64-hex payment key).
  Validates hex format. Builds via `buildRotateKadenaPactCode`, attaches
  patron + account guard data slots (matches the chain's
  `(read-keyset "ks")` / `(read-keyset "ks-account")` reads).
- `<RotateSovereignModal>` — Smart Account (Σ.) only. Single-input form
  (new sovereign address). Builds via the pre-existing
  `buildRotateSovereignPactCode`. Warns + disables submit on
  non-smart accounts (defense-in-depth — consumer should normally
  gate `isOpen` on `account.isSmart`).

All three:
- Accept `account` + `patron` props (default to active ouro account
  + same-account-as-patron).
- Expose `render` prop for full markup override + `renderSubmitButton`
  slot.
- Reset form state on every re-open.
- `isOpen` gating returns `null` when closed.
- Capture submit errors in local state; surface via default `<p role="alert">`
  or via render-prop's `lastError`.

Tests (+13) in `tests/rotation-modals.test.tsx`:
- isOpen=false renders nothing
- Default markup renders correctly under each modal
- Form validation gates the submit button
- Mode-switching toggles the right inputs (RotateGuard)
- render-prop receives full args bag
- Cancel button calls onClose
- Non-smart accounts trigger the alert + disable submit (RotateSovereign)

The actual submit-side wiring (build closure → strategy.execute → chain)
is verified implicitly: cfm-builders tests assert the emitted Pact code
string for each builder; useSignTransaction tests verify strategy
construction; Phase 9 OuronetUI migration is the end-to-end signal.

Workspace test totals after Phase 6b:
  kadena-stoic-legacy   55
  ouronet-codex        132 (was 119; +13 in Phase 6b)
  ouronet-core         797 (was 788; +9 from new builder tests)
  stoa-core            653
  total              1,637 passing, no regressions

### Phase 7 — CodexProvider full §5.1 surface (2026-05-25)

Fleshes the Phase 5 stub into the complete provider documented in
spec §5.1. Adds 4 new props + a SSR-safe shell + a second internal
context for the signingClient override:

- **`passwordCacheMinutes`** — TTL in minutes for the unlocked password
  cache. Applied on FRESH boot (when `schemaVersion === 0` after
  `adapter.loadAll()`). A previously-persisted
  `uiSettings.passwordCacheMinutes` overrides this on subsequent
  boots — the prop is the first-boot default, not a force-override.
- **`initialUiSettings`** — `Partial<UiSettings>` overlay applied
  on fresh boot only. Lets consumers ship custom defaults
  (e.g. `{ selectedNode: "node1" }` for a test environment) without
  fighting persisted user preferences.
- **`onCodexDirty`** — callback fired when the codex transitions from
  clean (`dirty: false`) to dirty (`dirty: true`). Subscribed via
  `store.subscribe()` so the callback fires on the EDGE only, not on
  every mutation while already dirty, and not on the initial clean
  state.
- **`signingClient`** — optional pre-configured `PactClient` override.
  When provided, `useSignTransaction` uses it instead of constructing
  one from `createClient(getPactUrl(KADENA_CHAIN_ID))`. Use cases:
  consumer routes Pact calls through a CF-worker proxy (production),
  test environments want a mock client, custom failover semantics.
  Exposed to the package's hooks via a new
  `useSigningClientOverride()` internal hook.

SSR-safe shell:
- `typeof window === "undefined"` check inside the init effect → adapter
  calls skipped on the server. Children still render, so consumers can
  ship a working SSR shell that hydrates on the client. No-op stub
  on the server with `MemoryCodexAdapter` is the recommended pattern
  per the spec.

Internals:
- Two contexts (store + signingClient). Splitting them keeps
  `useSignTransaction`'s lazy-construct fallback clean (returns null
  when no override, rather than forcing every hook to subscribe to
  client-related re-renders).
- Callback refs (`onCodexDirtyRef`, `passwordCacheMinutesRef`,
  `initialUiSettingsRef`) so consumers can pass fresh closures every
  render without re-running the init effect.

`useSignTransaction` updated to consume the override via
`useSigningClientOverride` — backward-compatible: when no override is
present (Phase 5/6 behaviour), still lazy-constructs the default
client and rebuilds on `selectedNode + customNodeUrl` change.

Tests (+11) in `tests/provider.test.tsx`:
- passwordCacheMinutes seeds on fresh boot
- passwordCacheMinutes does NOT override persisted value on re-boot
- initialUiSettings applies on fresh boot
- initialUiSettings does NOT override persisted settings on re-boot
- onCodexDirty fires on clean→dirty transition
- onCodexDirty does NOT fire on initial clean state
- onCodexDirty fires only on the EDGE (once per transition)
- useSigningClientOverride returns null without override
- useSigningClientOverride returns the supplied client
- useSigningClientOverride returns null outside any provider (no throw)
- SSR-safe shell renders children without crashing

Workspace test totals after Phase 7:
  kadena-stoic-legacy   55
  ouronet-codex        143 (was 132; +11 in Phase 7)

### Upcoming phases (per spec)

- Phase 8 — Publish v0.1.0 to npm with `alpha` dist-tag (plus triplet
  v4.3.0 published from the same release).
- Phases 9 + 10 — OuronetUI + AncientHoldings migration; API gaps surface
  as v0.x revisions before v1.0.0.
- Post-migration: `<RotateGovernorModal>` + `buildRotateGovernorPactCode`
  land once OuronetUI implements the UI surface.

See the spec doc for the full phase breakdown and acceptance criteria.
