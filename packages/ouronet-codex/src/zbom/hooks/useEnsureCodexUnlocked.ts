/**
 * useEnsureCodexUnlocked — cloned from OuronetUI `hooks/useEnsureCodexUnlocked.ts`.
 *
 * Returns a stable `() => Promise<boolean>` gate the ZBOM modals call before
 * signing: it ensures the codex password is available (prompting if locked),
 * returning false when the user cancels.
 *
 * Unlock window is **absolute, not sliding.** The TTL is started once — when
 * the user FRESHLY enters their password — and counts straight down. A cache
 * hit (codex already unlocked) does NOT extend it. The locked path starts the
 * window via `submitPasswordRequest()` → `authenticate()`; this hook only
 * (re)starts it on a fresh authentication, so routine operations within the
 * window leave the countdown untouched and the visible "re-authenticate in X"
 * timer means exactly what it shows. (Previously this called `authenticate()`
 * unconditionally, so every operation silently reset the timer to the full
 * TTL — a sliding window that never enforced the displayed deadline.)
 *
 * Data-seam swaps (T2, blueprint §7.2):
 *   - `useWallet().getCurrentPassword` → `useRequestPassword()` (package's
 *     Promise-returning prompt: resolves cached pw or shows <PasswordModal>).
 *   - `useCodex().uiSettings` stays (package's own Zustand-backed useCodex).
