 * what's already persisted in every existing user's localStorage; no
 * runtime migration needed when OuronetUI swaps the import paths in
 * Phase 9.
 *
 * Future evolution policy:
 *   - Additive fields only at minor bumps (consumer can ignore unknown fields).
 *   - Breaking shape changes only at major bumps with explicit codex migration.
 *   - The v1.2 codex file format (defined in @stoachain/ouronet-core/codex)
 *     is the wire-level contract; these types are the in-memory contract
 *     that hydrates from it. They share the same shape but evolve
 *     independently from the wire format (which is frozen at 1.2).
